					<h3> What is Performance Arts? </h3>
					<p> This form of art is a time sensitive fine art that ordinarily includes a live introduction to a crowd of people or to spectators (as on a road) and draws on such expressions as acting, verse, music, dance, and painting. It is a craftsmanship or workmanship presentation made through activities executed by the craftsman or different members. It very well might be live, through documentation, unexpectedly or composed, introduced to a public in a Fine Arts setting, customarily interdisciplinary. </p>
					<p> It is not quite the same as visual expressions, which is when specialists use paint, material or different materials to make physical or static workmanship objects. Performing expressions incorporate a scope of controls which are acted before a live crowd, prompting theater, music, and dance. </p>
					<h3> What about the history of Performing Arts? </h3>
					<p> Performing arts emerged in the mid 1970s as an overall term for a huge number of exercises - including Happenings, body workmanship, activities, occasions, and guerrilla theater. </p>
